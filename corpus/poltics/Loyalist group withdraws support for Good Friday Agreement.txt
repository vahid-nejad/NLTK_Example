he Loyalist Communities Council (LCC) said it was temporarily withdrawing its backing because of concerns about the Northern Ireland Protocol.

The protocol means NI remains in the EU single market for goods, so products from GB undergo EU import procedures.

Unionists say it damages trade and threatens NI's place in the UK.

In the letter, first reported by the Irish News, LCC chairman David Campbell said the group's leadership is "determined that unionist opposition to the protocol should be peaceful and democratic".

He added that the prime minister should not "underestimate the strength of feeling on this issue right across the unionist family".

Mr Campbell said the LCC's support for the Good Friday Agreement would be withdrawn "until our rights under the Agreement are restored and the protocol amended to ensure unfettered access for goods, services and citizens throughout the United Kingdom".

Responding to the letter, the prime minister's official spokesperson said he was "fully committed to the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement".

The official said the government was "determined" to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, and it was "simply looking to make some changes that have arisen as part of the protocol".
