PSG have a week and two domestic games before they take on Barcelona in the 2nd leg of their UEFA Champions League round of 16 showdown. Despite this, one can expect Mauricio Pochettino to have on eyes on the upcoming European showdown.

The Ligue 1 giants boast a huge lead, winning the first leg 4-1 at the Camp Nou. Les Parisiens have Kylian Mbappe to thank for this spectacular advantage, with the French superstar scoring a breathtaking hat-trick in Catalonia, setting UCL history along the way.

However, if there is one club that knows not to take a huge first-leg European lead for granted, it's PSG. After throwing away a 4-0 advantage to lose 6-5 on aggregate the last time these two sides met in the knockout stages, the French heavyweights must not slack off against the Spanish giants. 

Unfortunately, Pochettino looks set to be without one key player for the return leg, which is a huge blow. That man is none other than Neymar, This is according to Le Parisien, with the French publication claiming that the Brazilian is all but destined to miss out on the March 10 showdown.

Fans were looking forward to the Selecao star's return to Camp Nou but he was unfortunately ruled out of that fixture after picking up a hip injury in PSG's 1-0 cup win over Caen in early February. There was hope he would recover in time to share a pitch with former team-mate and close friend Lionel Messi but this appears unlikely.

Regardless, given how well the Ligue 1 title holders coped last time around, Mbappe and Co. should be confident for the second leg. The Parc des Princes must first handle their Wednesday league showdown with Bordeaux and their French Cup weekend tie against Brest before hosting the Catalan giants in the highly-anticipated fixture.
