The Walt Disney Company is closing at least 20% of its brick-and-mortar stores by the end of the year, as its focus shifts more and more towards e-commerce. At least 60 out of 300 Disney Stores will be closing across North America, and then an evaluation on whether to extend these closings to other parts of the world will begin.
The company plans to further utilize its popular shopDisney website and will be adding more “adult apparel collections, streetwear, premium home products, and collectibles” to the online store in the coming months.
