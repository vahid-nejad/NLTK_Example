Five students from MICA Ahmedabad are helping with research, content, digital marketing, design, and outreach activities for the first edition of the Heritage Olympiad to be held in January 2021.

Four postgraduate programme (PGP) second-year students and one Crafting Creative Communication (CCC) student are targeting 5,000 participants for the first edition.

“I am responsible for creating, implementing, and refining their social media strategy and helping build awareness, create market pulls, and increase overall engagement. I am enjoying it as every day I learn a new cultural trivia…,” said Anisha Vijaya, one of the five students.
