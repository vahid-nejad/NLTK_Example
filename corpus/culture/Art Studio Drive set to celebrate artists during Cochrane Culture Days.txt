COCHRANE— Creating a unique studio tour that can be enjoyed in-person or online, The Town of Cochrane has partnered with the Cochrane Integrated Art Society to celebrate Cochrane Culture Days.

The Artist Studio Drive is the perfect opportunity to travel around Town to a selection of studios that call Cochrane home on Saturday (Sept. 12) and Sunday (Sept. 13), said arts and culture programmer Jola Muran.

She added Culture Days is ready to bring the community together, but will also be offering a virtual way to attend the event.

“You have to have plan B,” Muran said with a laugh.

Muran is working to capture the different studios and create a virtual tour for guests to visit if they are unable to attend the event.

Culture Days is the perfect opportunity to celebrate local artists while pulling the community together in what has been a challenging year, she said.

There will be seven studios are participating and will be open for the community to come and visit online or in-person.

“It’s a great group of artists,” Muran said. “They are a terrific talented bunch of artists that are working with the times.”
